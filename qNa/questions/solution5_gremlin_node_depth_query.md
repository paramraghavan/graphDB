# Gremlin Query to Return Node Depth

In Gremlin, you can return the **depth** of a node (vertex), which represents how many edges (hops) it is away from a starting vertex in the traversal. This is typically done by counting the number of edges traversed from the root node to each node. Hereâ€™s how you can track and return the depth of nodes using Gremlin.

## Example Gremlin Query to Get Node Depth

```groovy
g.V(startingVertexId)
  .repeat(out())    // Traverse outward (depth-first search)
  .emit()           // Emit each node along the way
  .path()           // Capture the path from start to current node
  .project('node', 'depth')
    .by(identity())   // Return the current node
    .by(path().count(local).is(gt(1)).map { it.get() - 1 }) // Depth = path length - 1
```

### Explanation:

- **`g.V(startingVertexId)`**: Starts the traversal from a given vertex, which could be your root node (replace `startingVertexId` with the actual starting vertex ID).
- **`repeat(out())`**: Repeats the outward traversal through connected vertices (i.e., moving to child nodes). You can change `out()` to `in()` or `both()` depending on the direction of the edges you want to follow.
- **`emit()`**: Ensures that each node is emitted (included in the result set) as it is encountered during the traversal.
- **`path()`**: Captures the full path from the starting node to each encountered node, which allows us to calculate the depth.
- **`project()`**: Projects two values in the result: the node (`identity()`) and its depth.
- **`path().count(local)`**: Returns the number of steps in the path (which corresponds to the depth + 1, as the path includes the root node itself).
- **`is(gt(1)).map { it.get() - 1 }`**: Subtracts 1 from the path length to calculate the depth, since the starting node is depth 0.

## Example Output:
```json
[
  { "node": { "id": "1", "label": "root" }, "depth": 0 },
  { "node": { "id": "2", "label": "child1" }, "depth": 1 },
  { "node": { "id": "3", "label": "child2" }, "depth": 2 },
  { "node": { "id": "4", "label": "grandchild1" }, "depth": 3 }
]
```

## Customizations:
- **Direction of Traversal**: Use `out()`, `in()`, or `both()` to adjust the direction of traversal.
- **Edge Type Filtering**: Use `outE('edgeLabel').inV()` to filter the traversal based on specific edge labels.
- **Depth Limit**: You can control the maximum depth with `repeat().times(n)` to limit traversal to a certain number of hops.

This pattern can be useful when navigating hierarchical or tree-like structures in a graph.
