    * Managing user roles, permissions, and access control with fine-grained relationships.
    * Ensuring secure access to resources.


## Do I really need a Graph database or can we get the job done with  RDBMS

### When to Use a Graph Database
* **Complex Relationships:**
  If your data involves complex, many-to-many relationships that are deeply interconnected, a graph database can model
  these relationships more naturally and efficiently than an RDBMS. Graph databases excel at managing intricate
  networks, such as social networks, recommendation engines, or network and IT operations.
* **Dynamic Schema:**
  Graph databases are more flexible in terms of schema evolution. If your application's data model changes frequently, a
  graph database can adapt to these changes more easily without the need for significant schema modifications, which
  might be required in an RDBMS.
* **Highly Connected Data:**
  For applications that require traversing relationships between data points, such as finding the shortest path between
  two entities or exploring connections within a network, graph databases provide built-in operations that are optimized
  for these tasks.
* **Real-time Recommendations and Fraud Detection:**
  Applications that require real-time insights based on the relationships within the data, such as recommendation
  systems or fraud detection mechanisms, can benefit from the fast traversal capabilities of graph databases.

### When an RDBMS Might Suffice
* **Structured Data with Simple Relationships:**
  If your data is highly structured with clear, simple relationships (such as one-to-many or many-to-one), an RDBMS can
  efficiently manage this data. Relational databases are ideal for applications with well-defined schemas and
  straightforward relationship patterns.
* **Transactional Consistency:**
  For applications that require strong transactional consistency (ACID properties), RDBMSs have a long history of
  providing robust support for transactions. While some graph databases also offer ACID transactions, traditional RDBMSs
  are well-established in this area.
* **Reporting and Analytics:**
  RDBMSs often come with powerful tools for ad-hoc query analysis, reporting, and business intelligence. If your
  application requires complex reports that aggregate large amounts of data, an RDBMS might offer more mature tools and
  optimizations for these purposes.

The choice between a graph database and an RDBMS is not always mutually exclusive. Some applications might benefit from
using both in tandem, leveraging the strengths of each for different aspects of the application. For example, you might
use an RDBMS for handling transactions and reporting, while using a graph database to manage and query complex
relationships and networks within the same application.
