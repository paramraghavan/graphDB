# Introduction to Data Lineage & Source to Target Mapping

- Brief definition of data lineage: The journey of data from its origin through various transformations to its final form.
- Importance of data lineage: Ensures data accuracy, aids in compliance, and enhances understanding of data flow.
- Explanation of source to target mapping: The process of linking data fields from source systems to their corresponding fields in target systems.
- Significance of mapping: Critical for data integration, migration, and ensuring data integrity.

# Visualizing Data Lineage and Mapping

- Diagram  illustrating a simplified example of data lineage from source to target, including key transformations or processing steps
- Highlight a specific source to target mapping within the lineage, showing how a particular data field is transformed and mapped to the target system.
- Brief explanation of tools or methodologies used for visualization (e.g., data lineage tools, ETL diagrams).

# Benefits and Challenges
Benefits:
Improved Data Quality and Integrity: Ensuring that data is accurate and consistent across systems.
Enhanced Compliance and Governance: Facilitating audits and regulatory compliance by providing a clear audit trail.
Efficient Troubleshooting: Simplifying the identification of issues and their root causes in the data lifecycle.

Challenges:
Complexity in Implementation: Managing the complexity of mapping and lineage across diverse data systems and formats. - yaml
Maintaining Up-to-Date Documentation: Keeping documentation current with ongoing changes in data sources, transformations, and targets.- mdc/mdq
