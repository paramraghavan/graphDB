# Render
Visualize graph by connecting to AWS Neptune and work working jupyter notebook

>Pre-requisite
>> You should have loaded the airport and routes into the graph  by executing ../example/create_airport_routes_graph.py   

## Setup conda
```shell
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh
~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda 
```

## Create and start conda env  
- [Steps to setup Conda Env](https://github.com/paramraghavan/beginners-py-learn/blob/4019888505a849be9bbfda5f4c952b9101277c5a/setup_conda_env.md)

```shell
# -n flag to specify the name of the environment, creates the file
# conda create -n neptune_graph_viz
# This command creates an environment based on the dependencies listed in the "environment.yml" - neptune_graph_viz.yaml file.
conda env create -f ./neptune_graph_viz.yaml
conda activate neptune_graph_viz
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate

```

## Create Jupyter Kernel
Once ipykernel is installed, you can create a Jupyter kernel for your Conda environment using the following command:
```shell
# python -m ipykernel install --user --name your_environment_name --display-name "Your Environment Name"
python -m ipykernel install --user --name neptune_graph_viz --display-name "Neptune Graph Viz"

```

## start jupyter notebook
When Jupyter Notebook opens in your web browser, you should see the newly created kernel available in the "Kernel" menu under "Change kernel."
Inside your Jupyter Notebook, open the notebook where you want to use the Conda environment. In the top menu, click "Kernel" and select the kernel associated with your Conda environment

```shell
jupyter notebook
```
